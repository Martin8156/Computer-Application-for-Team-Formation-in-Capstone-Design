Team Meeting 1-22-2024

Professor messaged us about previous meeting, she was teaching
- Rescheduled for Wednesday 1-23 @ 1pm to 2pm

Objective, achieve a minimum viable product for the future groups to finish
- We have some debt from last semester that we need to conclude
- We have presentations as well as some more reports for this semester

Minimal Viable Product
- Take in a set of data and create groups
- No additional data and no additional questions
- Give data in a CSV and output CSV or Excel 

Academic Debt = System Design Report and Risk Reduction Activities and Risk Reduction Plan
- We have till the 4th week of school, probably by the Dennis meeting to get this done (MAKE SURE ABOUT THIS DUE DATE)
	- We need 5 Risk Reduction Activities (3 individual and 2 teams)
		- Risk Reduction Activities = Concrete Objective tasks to see how they work 
		- Individual is for smaller sections of the groups and Team is for the whole group, less applicable for a team of 3
		- Need to come up with some risk reduction activities
			- Ability to translate CSV to Python
			- Ability to translate Python to CSV
			- User interface that allows easier upload of CSV
			- User interface that displays information of finalized groups
			- Valid Solution Checker, checks for irregularities 
	- The Risk Reduction Plan
		- Not an assignment but a link with an upload?
		- ASK DENNIS about
		- Supposed to be made with the technical mentor and TA to help figure out activities
	- System Design Report
		- Has instructions and ruberic
		- A design approach, concept, and how we plan to achieve it
		- A test plan and talks about risk reduction activity
		- Also asks for several management explainers for how we structure ourselves including schedule and budget

This Semester Deliverables = Project Presentation Poster, Project Video, Oral Final Report, Written Final Report
- Project Presentation Poster
	- Banner Poster to show in oral presentation
	- Must go to a workshop on poster design 
- Project video
	- Time is 2min to 5min
	- Like a power point with specific look requirements
- Oral Final Report
	- Showcase to stakeholders
- Semester Writings 
	- Like updates on our current situation 
- Peer Assessment (1 through 3)

If push comes to shove, we can have a crunch night to finish up the Academic Debt before the final due date 

We don't have a super big plan of where everything goes froma more technical level. We have a big picture but we need to individual steps 

We don't have an algorithm to actual assign people.
- We need to create a plan for the algorithm
	- Take inspiration from other universities for the algo to create a minimum viable product  
	- Need to get this our quick to know what to fill out 


Next Steps
- Nate - Get a basic risk reduction activity like getting a CSV file to python in a readable file
- Ethan - System Design report work
- Gabe - Working on a front end including interactions with CSV files
