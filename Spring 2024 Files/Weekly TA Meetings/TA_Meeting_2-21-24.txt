We are on track to submit system design report and powerpoint presentation

Feedback
- We need a more concrete way to examine the completness of our project 
	- We need a way to judge the quality (compare the quality of previous assignments to current assignments)
	- We may need several metrics to review the post grouping data 
		- check the variance of the group's skills to the project's requirements
		- Check the GPA spread
	- We are basically trying to do better than the professor 
	- We should talk to the mentor about that

Questions of the system design report
- Do we need to document the process by which we create the algorithm or just the final product?
	- Basically we need to describe our end product and how we wish to achieve it (specification can't be too strict)

Is Christopher fitting well in the group?
- Yes, he is currently working on some of Nate's suggestions for the backend

We are going to do a greedy algorithm for our sort
