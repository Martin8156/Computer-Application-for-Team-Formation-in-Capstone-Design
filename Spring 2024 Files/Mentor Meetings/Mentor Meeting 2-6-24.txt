Premeeting notes
- Nate got done with a basic background code
	- it can make basic groupings and read the csvs
	- Implementation notes
		- Tried to convert all elements with integer values
			- "Interests" range from 1 to 5
			- Hardware, Software, or Both range from 0, 1, 2
			- NDA and other Binaries are 0 for no and 1 for yes
			- This will be useful because we can average these values for each specific grouping
				- We can then compare this average to the desired values for a project to analyze the 'fitness' of a grouping
	- Current concerns and next steps
		- We do not have a way to try and sort for this fitness, just a way to measure it
		- Groupings are represented as strings rather than lists 


Meeting Notes
- Meeting with Dennis, we will ask about the new member of the team that we discovered 
- We want data attributes to be able change

- We have a new member which is kinda confusing
	- Need to get them to read our previous documents to understand at least some basis of what we are doing
	- Try not to worry about it
	- Give them the github link 
	- Information we need to get
		- Their schedule, their skills, and boundaries, and what they need to read
- Doccuments need to have been reread
- Goals
	- Next time we need to be able to demo the code
	- Need to display current group set
	- Need to rate the fitness of groups
	- Need algorithm to create groupings
