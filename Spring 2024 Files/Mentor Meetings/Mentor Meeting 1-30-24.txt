Mentor Meetin for 1-30

Documents are currently "moving" from what Ethan said but our priority should be Risk Reduction activities from technical TA
Everything is due at the end of next week 
Our System Design Report requires that the risk reduction activities done

Our front end has been making progress with initial errors being addressed 
- Getting the arranged groups displayed is important 

We can upload the the CSV
- Make the file we need to parse as simple as possible
	- Break it into two files, one for projects and one for students
	- Make sure that they have the same features 
	- "Parsing is hell" Mentor says from experience
	- Any data not entered must be flagged and noticable (we need version 1 as soon as possible)
	- Definitely use the Data Labs and Data Principles tools like Pandas or Numpy tools 
- Make sure to have some kind of version, can make it user friendly later 
	- Make a note for later so to not forget about features not yet implemented or also a comment 
	- Stay within the bounds of the assignment 
	- Just list the catagories in one file to try and compare to the projects and students 
		- Again flag any problematic data 
		- Make sure we have an agreement on the data structures for ease of implementations 
		- Front end should flag any issues for risk mitigation 
- One structure for students and one for projects 
- Need to get this done by Friday 

We need a way to display code for 1.0 and that is critical 
- Need layout for react 

Design Report is at the end of next week 

The different algorithms are a pain so we should focus on getting the simplest first and modify it from there
- Editing is easier than creating 

We need code by the next time we meet
- Basic Display, Simple Algo, Reasonable Data Structure

We are running a little late so we need to have code to show 


Post Meeting Notes with Team 
Data strucutre (Pandas Dataframes)
- Array of Students 
	- Use dataframes with rows for each students, columns for features
- Array of Projects
	- Use dataframes with rows for each projects, columns for features
- We all have experience with pandas so we can figure out errors together
