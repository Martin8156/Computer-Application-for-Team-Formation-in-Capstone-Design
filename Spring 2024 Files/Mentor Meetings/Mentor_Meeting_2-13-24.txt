Mentor Meeting 2-13-24

We introduce Christopher Pung as our new teammate 
- Chris is fine to reference them 

What have we done and how 
- We connect front and back end are connected 
- Deal with the hard constraints first
	- Like the algorithm, try and make a stupid algorithm 
		- Similar to the NFL draft or an established sort
		- Maybe try and figure out which things are the rarest through an initial sort 
- Interaction is through the consol but we can display the teams 
	- Probably the first thing we want to do is to spit out the list of teams 
	- We are getting near the point that we need to show our user something, do not be complicated 
	- We need to show the data has been sucked in correctly 
- Ethan wrote up an example algorithm that we can use in the system design document 
	- Ethan should work with who ever is writing the implementation
- So we need a simple sorting algo and a basic front end 

Chris has a focus in software and will be graduating soon 
- Very good for pair programming to do sanity checks where we explain our process to Chris
- I, Nate, know that I need to actually write out my comments that I missed 
- Try and find some time to figure when to work with Chris
- Someone needs to give Chris a list of things to do, Ethan has taken job
- We can get the demo going around 2 weeks 

Future stuff
- We want to have the client send in the csv files to the back end 
	- Future problem, not for the immediate demo
- we need like to have a simple algo for the demo in two weeks 
	- Ethan will help Nate with that 
- Don't spend too much time on screen output cause client will want something different 
- Try and export as a CSV file with pandas dataframe 
- Really need to get that demo 
- Gabe needs to work on rework the transfer
	- Make some tweaks from JSON to a usable format for the front end 


Post Meeting
- Nate needs to work on Ethan's Algorithm that he made
	- Will probably work on weekend
- Chris needs to catch up on reading materials (middle to late this week)
- Gabe is working on teams displayed on front end 
	- he took code the main file and samples and moved that to dashboard in backend 
	- I will delete the code/file but make sure the CSVs are still pulled
- Ethan will work on the presentation slides in like a week due on the 23rd 
	- He will also work with the algo
