Chris managed to do his reading and examined sample excel sheet for errors

We are creating the algortihm needed, basically just seperating hardware and software slots for projects and assigning students based on their preference of either or both
- pathological cases: preferences of students far from projects
	- mark the team as having a trouble  and fill the slots with available individuals
	- try not to spend too much time to solve pathological cases
	- need somewhere to specify if a sub specialty is hardware or software
		- "Hardware: feature name"

NFL draft, do projects draft the teammates (finer sorting based on information)
- Sort projects by their preference lists of features, sort people based on skills

General heuristic
	- Make lists of people with each each characteristic and check supply of each feature 

Basically we want a lot of preprocessing analysis 
- Take an average of each feature and the lowest average is the smallest supply for students and projects
- Try and slot them based on greatest variance
- When it comes to algorithmic efficiency, it does not matter just get it done 

Mentor Gut feeling: after averages are calculated, first pass should be really dumb and fix from there

After it is done, we need to say what we need to improve

Frontend
- We have code that can display, it is functional 
	- It displays the groupings, but not the ratings
	- we want to display the final ratings for ease of reading 
- Needs
	- Two views, one project focused, one that is student focused 
	- We need to be able to export it as a csv 

Setting up a presentation for Register and Mentor 
	- Tuesdays and Thursdays should be available 

Chris can help with pre-processing analysis
