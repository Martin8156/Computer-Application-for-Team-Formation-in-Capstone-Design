# Overview

In *backend* directory, we have kept different versions of our solvers for considerations of different constraint priorities.

Currently there exists two versions of our solver, both of which maximizes the team affinity of the set of all teams by minimizing the min team score in that set.

1. Dot Product of Skill Abilities
   * Makes assignments based on individual fitness to a group.
2. Company Neediness
   * Makes assignments based on collective skillset to a group

# Preprocessing

*Data Structures to Setup*

1. List of student objects

```
 student = {
        "name": row["Name"],
        "eid": row["EID"],
        "skill_set": # skillNumber : individual rating
    }
```

2. List of project objects

```jsx
 project = {
        "name": row["Project_ID"],
        "skill_req": # skillNumber : project neediness

```

3. Team Allocation object (example 2D numpy array shown below)

|           | Project 1 | Project 2 | Project 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Student 1 | TRUE      |           |           |
| Student 2 |           | TRUE      |           |
| Student 3 |           |           | TRUE      |
| Student 4 | TRUE      |           |           |
| Student 5 |           |           | TRUE      |
| Student 6 |           | TRUE      |           |

TRUE denotes assignment between student and project. A student can only be assigned to one project, and team sizes are also constrained.


*CP-Model at a High-Level glance*

We implement the following decision variables:

```jsx
min_goodness
team_goodness_list
team_allocation_object
```

And the following constraint:

```jsx
model.AddMinEquality(min_v, team_goodness_list) 
```

Now, we only change the definition of *goodness* between the solvers based on desired constraints.

# Solver 1 - Dot Product of Skill Abilities

Optimizing min team goodness by individual affinity towards group project

```jsx
Project Beta: [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3]
Students A to I: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]	     DotProduct(any student A to I, Z)  = 61 affinity
Student Z: [2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2]		         DotProduct(student 10, Z) = 55 affinity

Student Z would NOT be selected, despite Project Beta rating a much higher need value for a skill possesesd by Student Z
```

---

# Solver 2 - Company Neediness

Optimizing min team goodness by scaling collective group skill vector by dividing it with the projectâ€™s skill rating (project neediness)

```jsx
skill_vector = [10,5]
group_need = [3,2]
scaled_skill_vector = [3.3, 2.5]
```
