Quick Notes (Mentor 12-1)
- We need to get started on the code as quickly as possible as it will help us to try and define our scope and understand the problem
- For data display on the project, we should model it after a dashboard with multiple simple charts for readability 
	- Might be important to talk to him about what information we might want to display
	- We need a project view of individual projects, a student view for individual students, and larger charts with some basic information that would be important
	- The mentor suggests taking the effectiveness score less seriously compared to other metrics because the end user will change their mind 
		- Expect the end user to change their mind
		- We need something to show the end user so that the client can define what they want better
- Make sure to highlight teams missing certain parameters 
- Really nailed the idea of having a draft to show the client so that they can better describe their needs
- Really need something to show the client as early as possible from his enormous email
	- We should specifically show him front end
- Successful project has the architecture, the front end, and a draft of the student allocation
	- Implement what the client wants now first 
	- The planning is going to be the hardest part
- Software always takes longer than desired 
	- We need documentation for the next guy 
- We need to schedule weekly meetings 
- Need to lay out a plan for the next semester to make it managable
- Weekly meeting for Mondays from 3pm to 4pm (Jan 22nd)
	- We should make like an agenda, Gabe said he can do Agendas
- We need to create a development schedule to show, break down goals into small goals
- Engineers have problems with communication
- She really suggests pair programming and code review with each other to make documentation easier
- Make meaningful comments adn maybe even copy Dr. Register's stuff
	- Explain your reasoning not your specific details 
	- Something that describes the overall architecture should not be in comments but the readme
- We need to split into our own design roles
- We should post the stuff we have to the github
