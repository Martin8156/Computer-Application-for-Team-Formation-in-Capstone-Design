Group Meeting 11-6

Confusion between Mentor and Client 
We need to meet with Mentor 

Needs:
- Project Document
- Research Document
- Risk Assessment 
- Set up programming architecture
- Looking for an excel sheet output

Enforce some level of modularity 
- He wants groups to be average or better
- Scores are like a budget 
- Make sure to avoid constraint duplicates 

Ethan's Frontend skills - Web application in react and javascript which can be done offline 

Measure of how good our output is
- Look at total range 
- Look for outliers
- Point system should be out of 15 (5+4+3+2+1)
- Different method to check Interest vs Experience for each completed group

Try and finish a small subset of a problem 
- Will help with defining classes 

Classes
- Student
- Constraint
- Groups
- Projects 
	- Sets of requirements
	- Some required constraints
	- Some constructed constraints
	- Name and description 

Edge Cases
- What about projects with some hardware but mostly software needs
	- Add a functionality to the classes to check this
	- Make sure certain projects meet certain requirements

Good and Bad
- We need to look at GPAs and make sure the spread is too big
	- Avoid a really low GPA group 
	- Make the highest value possible for GPA floor

We have a preference with Java in the background and Data Analysis with Python 

We need to look into a browser based GUI

Action Items:
Nate - Look into project definition and another meeting with Mentor
Ethan - Look into project definition and another meeting with Mentor
Gabe - Look into project definition and another meeting with Mentor

December 4th, there is a capstone design showcase (talk to the professor about that)
Come up with a project name
