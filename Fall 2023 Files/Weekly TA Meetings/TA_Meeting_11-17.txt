TA Meeting (11-17)
- Finish the Risk reduction next semester within the first 3 weeks and by the 4th weeks get the system project report done
- Absolutely Make sure sure to get the prior art report and preliminary definition done before end of the semester (Do the risk reduction activities later)
- Last Class day for this class is December 4th 
- System design report is due November 29th
- Basically this semester is all about finishing the deliverables 
- As Gabriel said that the mentor said, having something to report is really good to show the client
- Ethan already talked to the professor about our academic requirements and what we need to do but we may need a better understanding of what we can do this semester
	- Just like specifically can wait and what can not wait seems to be an issue with what we are doing
- TA says to look over the syllabus and says there is no showcase part for the class this semester
